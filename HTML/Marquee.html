    <h1>Greek Mithology</h1>
    <br>
     <p><marquee>Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks, and a genre of ancient Greek folklore, today absorbed 
            alongside Roman mythology into the broader designation of classical mythology. 
            These stories concern the ancient Greek religion's view of the origin and nature of the world; 
            the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and mythological creatures; and the origins and significance of the ancient Greeks' 
            cult and ritual practices. Modern scholars study the myths to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece, 
            and to better understand the nature of myth-making itself</marquee></p>
